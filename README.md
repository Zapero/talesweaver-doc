# Talesweaver Documentation

This repository is dedicated to documenting the MMO Talesweaver, focusing on client revision 8xx.

[Talesweaver](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TalesWeaver) uses a version of the Nexon DoomVAS engine, similar to the one used in *[Dark Ages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_Ages_(1999_video_game))*, but it seems to be a newer revision.

The primary focus is on two key areas:

* **File Crypto:** Analyzing and documenting the encryption and compression methods used for client game files.
* **Network Protocol:** Analyzing and documenting the packet encryption and opcodes.

This project is for educational and research purposes only.
